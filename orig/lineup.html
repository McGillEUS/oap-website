Assembled in the vibrant city of Montreal, their grassroots approach reflects a real love for music and artistic performance. Josh met Shawn as a last minute addition to a talent show in Champlain College while Myles and Josh became acquainted through mutual friends studying at McGill University. Josh and Shawn’s love for music fused with Myles’ songwriting and experience in the Manitoba music scene to form the early beginnings of the band. After experimenting with a few different lineups in Josh’s parents’ basement, the three-piece band moved to the legendary 1180 Saint Antoine and spent an entire summer writing, practicing and sweating out original music. Three years later, the group is recognized as one of Montreal’s young, up and coming rock and roll bands. The epitome of a front man, Myles’ long hair and aggressive stage antics are a distinct element of Café Racer’s “captivating stage presence". Shawn's "appropriately fuzzy and inventive bass lines" laid over Josh's "highly entertaining and precise" drumming come together with Myles’ wailing guitar and howling vocals to create a refreshing sound and highly energetic live show.</p>

Formed by songwriter Luke Roes in 2012, the band has been riding an upward spiral ever since. After enlisting a new rhythm section in the fall 2013 they released ‘Mary’ – a colorful, pop-laden EP embracing a new danceable and polished sound. The title track entered regular rotation on local radio, CBC and charted on campus radio across the country. Upbeat music videos for ‘Mary’ and ‘Hello Honey’ gained traction online, landing features in Noisey, Exclaim, Popdose and the front page of Reddit. The band released their full-length debut album 'Morning Light' on June 9th 2015; a collection of ten exciting, infectious pop tunes co-produced by Dan Brodbeck (The Cranberries, Dolores O'Riordan) and mastered by Joao Carvalho (Lights, Stars). The first single 'I Won't' debuted on Indie88 in Toronto and took the band to the Top 4 in CBC's Searchlight competition. After notable sets at both Canadian Music Week and NXNE 2015, Ivory Hours will spend the rest of the year touring, with a new MuchFACT funded video for 'Dreamer' on the way.

Working with various local producers, Taigenz took up the task of manufacturing and promoting his album independently, selling many during his three-year career program at Dawson College. He has since invested all the money from his past mixtapes into professionally producing the upcoming “Muntree EP”.In 2013, Taigenz embarked on a three-city tour with the Wu-Tang Clan affiliate member to Ottawa, Toronto and Hamilton. Having opened for American hip-hop artists like Canibus, M.O.P., Denzel Curry, and performed in Paris, Atlanta and a number of Canadian colleges and universities, Monsieur 514 himself has began to regard his Canadian heritage as a growing part of his persona As a teenager, Taigenz developed his music as part of a collective of other hip hop artists called Black Glovez which opened for Big K.R.I.T. At the Belmont and Wiz Khalifa at MTL's Corona Theater. While artists like Nipsey Hussle, J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar and Drake are some of his current inspirations, Taigenz cites influences of a by-gone era like Nas, Eminem, 50 cent, Tupac, Biggie, Jay Z; a soon-to-be retiring generation of hip-hop pioneers and rap game-changers. The “Muntree EP” is a 7 track project all produced by his new musical partner Chamandy and is now available online via Live Mixapes, Bandcamp and Soundcloud.

                            <p class = "D-ib"><span class="Fw-b">F</span>ormed in the basement of a student house in Kingston, ON, Lost Cousins is an indie rock outfit known for thoughtful songwriting, intricate arrangements and high-energy live shows. Focused on creating music that fills body and mind, Lost Cousins present lush harmonies and creative rhythms, giving their sound a unique and ethereal quality that is truly its own. Over the past year and a half Lost Cousins has toured throughout Ontario and Quebec, playing with acts such as Hollerado, The Wooden Sky, and Zeus. The band recently released their debut EP, Not Now What We Were, produced by Darryl Neudorf (Neko Case, Blue Rodeo) and mastered by Peter Moore (The Band, Cowboy Junkies). The collection of songs showcases the diversity of the band's sound, blending influences from the past with soulful lyrics that express growth and transformation. Much more than being great music to dance to, it is music to be remembered.

Since then, we have become a bilingual collective that amalgamates the different styles of music (hip -hop , funk, jazz , soul, reggae) . The core sound of this group comes from Clay’s Mc’ing and Aydell’s beatbox , while the melodies and harmonies are put together by Samish and Clement on guitar and Pascal on the Bass . The ideals of simplicity and instinct are very present in this organic project in the sense that, through spontaneity the musicians can feed off the energy of the crowd and exploit new paths for each performance. In November 2013, the group released its first EP: A Quest Called Jam III . Within the ideology of hip- hop, where the past is used to form the present, this project is a reflection of the cultural and musical diversity of the group insofar as it presents a collection of several musical styles and cultural backgrounds under the same title. In June 2014, Clay and Friends released the All Day Jam Ep as well as the All Day Jam Short Movie. This project was made with the collaboration of over 20 musicians and vocalists from Montreal. Since its beginning a little more than a year ago, Clay and Friends has played over a 100 shows in and out of Montreal, and has been featured live on Musique Plus.</p>

Through their music, Fleece gaps the bridge between psychedelic, alternative rock, grunge, and jazz. One year after their formation (January 2015), Fleece released their debut album "Scavenger," featuring 9 dynamic songs that showcase their unique fusion of genres. With the release of their new album, Fleece has gained a much larger public outreach, where at their release show, a sold-out crowd of over 400 people danced, sang and moshed to their new tunes. The album "Scavenger" received 4,700 listens on bandcamp.com in one week, and has also received air time on campus radio stations such as CJLO. The album received a score of "Hunting Call: Excellent" on a review by Canadian music blog Greyowl Point.Currently each member of Fleece shares a collective passion towards writing and performing music, and has high hopes to further their establishment in the Canadian music scene. While they have fun and love what they do, they also plan to pursue music as a profession by being a part of Fleece. Their efforts to making this happen may be seen and heard on Bandcamp, Youtube, Facebook and Instagram. The members of Fleece consist of Matthew Rogers on Keyboard/Vocals, Jon Bell on Guitar/Saxophone/Vocals, Colin Spratt on Guitar, Gabe Miller on Bass Guitar, and Ethan Soil on Drums.</p>

SHYRE's lush strings and angelic harmonies combine in a soundscape often described as ethereal and innocent in a marriage of orchestra and pop. The group began as a McGill student project in which musicians of all kinds, from violin to harp, came together to produce something cinematic and fantastic. Their first single "Let Go" earned them a spot in CBC Searchlight's Top 10 in the region of Montreal. From performances on Global TV, to features on CBC and other radio stations, the group has continued to gain popularity in the greater Montreal region. This summer they toured eastern Québec in promotion of their debut EP entitled "Winds", to be officially released in September 2014. Keep your eyes and ears open for SHYRE, Montreal's musical fairytale.

                            <p class = "D-ib"><span class="Fw-b">H</span>ailing from the Canadian Laurentians, these four young men met while still in high school in 2010 and created what we now know to be Foreign Diplomats. Their fusion of indie pop with elements of dancey electro funk caught the eyes and ears of Montreal label Indica Records in 2013 who immediately signed them. The group released their first self-titled EP which landed a spot on Deezer's "Best of 2013" playlist and led to frequent touring including performances at M for Montreal, Expo Quebec, opening slots for Phantogram and Half Moon Run, as well as a concert at the Montreal International Jazz Festival, opening for Violent Femmes. Late in 2014, Foreign Diplomats entered the studio with American producer Brian Deck (Modest Mouse, The Shins, Counting Crows) to record their debut album. The album entitled Princess Flash is slated for release October 2015.</p>

Founded by Mike Valletta and Matt Gillis, the band is known for their pop rock with hints of “feel good” reggae. Having shared the stage with some of today’s best known artists, including Simple Plan, Down With Webster, Sean Paul, B.O.B, The Wanted, Flo Rida and many more, there is no crowd M.T.L can’t incite to riot… in a good way! Three hit radio singles, a #1 Video on TV, and some fantastic shows coming out of their debut album, M.T.L was off to a promising start. Following the release of these charts topping singles, M.T.L has had success on television as well. Their music video for “Red Cups” stole and maintained the #1 spot for best video on Musique Plus for several weeks. After countless tours, festivals, TV and radio performances M.T.L have built a raging high octane live show packed with energy, high-flying acrobatics, and crowd sing alongs.

Samuel Chaco Kohn, Daniel Pombo and Zaynab “Zaya” Solange bring forth a new brand of pop they call funkadelic swing, a mix of funk, jazz and soul with a rocking edge. “Static Gold is definitely living up to its name; their live performances are beyond electrifying and their energy surges into the crowd” – The Main Montreal With the addition of talented musicians Louis “Loud Hands” Souverain, Beth Mckenna and Thomas Viardot, the ensemble has performed with local and international bands alike, such as Busty & The Bass, Sidewalk Chalk, and Grammy Award nominees Jarabe de Palo. Even before the release of their debut album “Speaking Easy” in May 2014, Static Gold’s love for performance had led them to win over crowds in many different types of avenues, from top venues in Quebec and Ontario, to the International Jazz Festival in Montreal. “An explosive ensemble!” – Quebec Spot. With Static Gold’s very first music video “Fury’s Dance” released in April 2015, the band now aims to keep spreading good vibes across geographic borders.

The Ottawa-based four piece has also performed at some of Canada's leading festivals including Bluesfest, NXNE, JUNOfest,Canadian Music Week and among others. Formed in Ottawa in 2010, Zoo Legacy's sound can be categorized as alternative hip hop. The bands music blurs the lines between hip-hop, indie rock, R&amp;B, and pop. Consisting of rapper Nick Pouponneau and multi-instrumentalists Mark Milloy, Dominic and Samuel Goss, the bands music appeals to rock fans and hip-hop fans alike. While not easy to pinpoint, Zoo Legacy's style falls somewhere in the category currently occupied by artists such as Gorillaz, M.I.A., and KiD CuDi.
